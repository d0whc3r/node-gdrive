## :key: Create credentials and token files

To get `credentials.json` file you need to visit:
- [https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs)

Then click `ENABLE THE DRIVE API` and click `DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION`

This will download **credentials.json** file, you can save it in *secrets* folder in the project.
Now you need to generate **token.json** file, to do this you need to execute any command to access your google-drive, for example:

### :boat: Using docker

Then you could execute a simple command to generate token.json:

> Be careful to copy `credentials.json` into `$PWD/secrets` path

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/secrets:/app/secrets/ d0whc3r/gdrive -l
```

### :pencil: Using downloaded project

> First you need to download project from github using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d0whc3r/node-gdrive.git
cd node-gdrive
yarn install
```

Then you could execute a simple command to generate token.json:

```bash
yarn cli -l
```

### :beginner: Next step

Using docker or project files the `-l` command is for listing existing files in google-drive

If *credentials.json* is present but *token.json* is missing this last file will be generated showing an url into terminal output, you need to enter that url and validate all needed permisions, then a token will be shown in your web browser, this token need to be pasted in terminal.

By default this software check for credentials (and token) file in folder `secrets` but it could be changed using environment variables:
- **CREDENTIALS_FILE**: File with credentials (credentials.json)
- **TOKEN_FILE**: File with token, generated using credentials (token.json)

## :boat: Docker usage

You could use cli app in docker

### :rowboat: Build docker image

```bash
docker build -t gdrive .
```

### :checkered_flag: Run cli commands inside docker

```bash
docker run --rm gdrive --help
```
To make docker image work properly you need to indicate where credentials and token are located

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD/secrets:/app/secrets:ro gdrive -l
```

## :checkered_flag: Cli help output

Using docker image from [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/r/d0whc3r/gdrive)

```bash
docker run --rm d0whc3r/gdrive --help
```

```
